## Behavior

The action downloads the requested Ptah release binary by default. If a release
asset is not available yet, it falls back to:

```bash
GOPROXY=direct go install github.com/stokaro/ptah/cmd/ptah@master
```

when `version` is `latest`. Direct module fetch avoids stale Go module proxy
results for moving refs. Use `binary-path` when a workflow builds Ptah from
source before invoking the action.

The action runs:

```bash
ptah migrations plan --report text
ptah migrations plan --report json --check-destructive
ptah migrations lint --format json
```

The text plan is generated without `--check-destructive` so the pull request
comment still contains SQL for review. The separate JSON safety command drives
the destructive-change failure gate and Check Run.

## Provenance

This repository packages the composite action source maintained in
[`stokaro/ptah`](https://github.com/stokaro/ptah) under
`.github/actions/ptah`.

## Generating the migration

With `generate: true` the Action runs `ptah migrations generate` into
`migration-dir` and lists the files in the sticky comment, with their SQL, so a
reviewer reads what would be committed rather than a plan of it. It is off by
default: a job that only reviews should not write files.

The files are written into the workspace and **not committed**. What happens to
them is the workflow's decision, because the two answers have different
requirements:

```yaml
      - uses: stokaro/ptah-action@v1
        id: ptah
        with:
          dir: ./internal/models
          db-url: ${{ secrets.PTAH_DATABASE_URL }}
          generate: "true"

      # Commit them to the contributor's branch. Needs `contents: write`, and
      # does nothing useful on a pull request from a fork, where the token has
      # no write access to the head repository.
      - if: steps.ptah.outputs.generated-count != '0'
        run: |
          git add $(cat "${{ steps.ptah.outputs.generated-list-path }}")
          git -c user.name=ptah -c user.email=ptah@users.noreply.github.com \
            commit -m "chore: generate migration"
          git push
```

The alternative is to leave them uncommitted and let the author take the SQL
from the comment. That needs no write scope and works on forks, at the cost of
a manual step.

### The line generation must stay behind

`ptah migrations rebase` refuses a migration the target database has already
applied. That check reads one database, and **unapplied is not unpublished**: a
migration already pushed to an OCI registry lives in an immutable artifact, so
renumbering the local files produces a directory whose migration identities
disagree with an artifact someone may already be deploying. Re-hashing and
`--verify-sum` do not catch it, because the renumbered directory does agree
with its own integrity file.

Nothing refuses a rebase because a version was published. So generation belongs
before the publication step, and an automation that renumbers has to know where
that line is -- in practice, that a version is published once its branch merged
and the publish job ran.

## Choosing the desired schema

The Action forwards the source to Ptah rather than reinterpreting it. Each
input maps to the flag Ptah already has, so anything Ptah accepts works here:

```yaml
      # Go annotations, as before
      - uses: stokaro/ptah-action@v1
        with:
          dir: ./internal/models
          db-url: ${{ secrets.PTAH_DATABASE_URL }}

      # A SQL, YAML, HCL, DBML, or OCI source. No Go toolchain is installed.
      - uses: stokaro/ptah-action@v1
        with:
          schema-file: ./schema.sql
          db-url: ${{ secrets.PTAH_DATABASE_URL }}

      # An external program that prints the schema
      - uses: stokaro/ptah-action@v1
        with:
          schema-cmd: go run ./loader
          schema-format: sql
          db-url: ${{ secrets.PTAH_DATABASE_URL }}
```

`dir` and `schema-file` take one value per line and compose, the way repeating
`--root-dir` and `--schema-file` composes on the command line.

### Two behaviours worth knowing

**`dir` no longer defaults to `.`** A run that selected a SQL file used to scan
the working directory for Go entities as well, and silently composed a schema
nobody asked for. Selecting nothing at all still falls back to `--root-dir .`,
so an existing workflow is unaffected.

**Go is installed only when a Go source is selected.** `setup-go` still
decides, but a run whose schema is a SQL file installs no toolchain even with
the default `setup-go: true`.

**A `schema-format` with no `schema-cmd` fails with exit 2** before Ptah runs.
The format describes the output of a command that is not there, and running
anyway would silently ignore the input.
